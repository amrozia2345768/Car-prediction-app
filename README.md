# Car-prediction-app
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars. The model helps users estimate a fair price based on input factors such as car age, kilometers driven, fuel type, ownership, and transmission type. A user-friendly web app was created using Streamlit to interact with the model.
