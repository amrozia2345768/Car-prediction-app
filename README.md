# Car-prediction-app
In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict the selling price of used cars. The model helps users estimate a fair price based on input factors such as car age, kilometers driven, fuel type, ownership, and transmission type. A user-friendly web app was created using Streamlit to interact with the model.
Dataset & Features Used
The dataset contained information on various used cars. After preprocessing, the final features used for prediction were:
Present_Price
Driven_kms
Owner
Car_Age
Fuel_Type_Diesel
Fuel_Type_Petrol
Selling_type_Individual
Transmission_Manual
Tools & Libraries
Python – Programming language
Pandas & NumPy – Data manipulation
Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization
Scikit-learn – Machine learning model (Random Forest Regressor)
Pickle – Model serialization
Streamlit – For web app deployment
VS Code – Development environment
What I Learned
Data cleaning and preprocessing
One-hot encoding of categorical features
Feature selection and engineering
Training and evaluating ML models
Saving/loading models with pickle
Creating and deploying interactive apps using Streamlit
